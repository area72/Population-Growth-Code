# Population-Growth-Code
Given basic inputs, this calculator predicts population for given year

THis is contained within a single python file.

Whaat it does:
Given current population count and details such as fertility rate, this calculator will predict population at a future  year input by user.

What inputs are taken:
Current Year
Current Population
Fertility Rate
Infant Mortality Rate
Lifespan
Age at conception for women
Year of interest ( future year whose population is desired to be known

What are assumptions made by this calculator:
1. Men and women have same infant mortality rate as well as lifespan
2. Death is only at end of lifespan
3. Sex ratio is 50:50
4. Initially population is equally distributed throughout all ages

What python features does this project make use of:
1. Lists
2. File operations (txt file alone)

What are the outputs of the program:
1. A file with population count till for each year from current year to year of interest
2. Population doubling time ( if it will double in reasonable future)
